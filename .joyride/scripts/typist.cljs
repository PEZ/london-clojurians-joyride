;; To type the contents of the clipboard in a text editor,
;; or an input prompt, you can define a keyboard shortcut:
;;
;;    {
;;        "command": "joyride.runCode",
;;        "args": "(typist/type-clipboard :fast)",
;;        "key": "ctrl+alt+t f",
;;    },
;;
;; NB: First you need to load this script. You can do that
;; by using the command **Joyride: Run Workspace Script**
;; Or by requiring this script from either:
;; * `user_activate.cljs`
;; * `workspace_activate.cljs`
;; 
;; There is also the extension *Paste Replace* that does
;; this and some more useful things:
;; * https://github.com/PEZ/paste-replaced
